# Synopsis

Y’know what, in recent months I’ve come to really enjoy writing my own maths questions. So much like [*Assort*](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) is a repository of all my creations, *Integrity* is a collection of all my maths questions. (At least, that’s what it started out as.)

Currently, most of these were written for maths competitions at school, including an Integration Bee, Competitive Completing the Square and Christmas Maths Advent ([*Addvent*](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/addvent)).
