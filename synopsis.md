# Synopsis

Y’know what, in recent years I’ve come to really enjoy writing my own maths questions. Much like [*Assort*](https://github.com/Sup2point0/Assort) is a repository of all my creations, *integrity* is a collection of all my maths questions.


## Site
- Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) + [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) for styling
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org) for LaTeX
- [MDSveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io) for Markdown
- My own [Stranger Quarkdown](https://github.com/Sup2point0/stranger-quarkdown) for automating content deployment

## Questions
- Written in Markdown with LaTeX
- Preprocessed by a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) script into JSON for integration (heh) with the site
