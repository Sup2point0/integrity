Integrals are the heart of *Integrity*. My original reason for creating this site was to store and archive all the integrals I’ve written.


## What kinds of integrals go on *Integrity*?

I started writing integrals for my school’s Integration Bee. I think I ended up writing about 300 questions, but most of these were fairly formulaic or trivial, unworthy of going on *Integrity*.


## What do I need to know?

It’s painfully nontrivial to pinpoint a precise ‘threshold’ for what level of integration ability is required, or provide a comprehensive ‘specification’ for what knowledge you need. The difficulty and style of integrals on *Integrity* varies hugely, and of course everyone will perceive them differently depending on their exposure and experience.

I will say that if you are confident with the integration taught in A-level [Further Mathematics<sup>↗</sup>](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_Mathematics),[^a-level] the basic principles you learn there will leave you in a good spot for tackling *Integrity*’s integrals. The [cheatsheet](../guides/integrals/collections/everything-anything.md) should also act as a useful checklist for algebra and calculus you should be familiar with.

[^a-level]: Or anything equivalent to A-levels – I’m not particularly familiar with the maths taught in other qualifications.

Now, my integrals are quite different in purpose, style and difficulty to A-level integrals – they’re intricate puzzles designed to make you think and ponder, more than examination questions trying to assess your understanding of integration. It’s certainly great to challenge yourself, and I love tackling tough integrals I have no idea how to solve, but if you’re not that comfortable yet with how to integrate, I would recommend practising with easier, more formulaic problems first before tackling *Integrity*.

And remember, integration is not a lone topic – polynomials, trigonometry, exponentials – they’re all very much relevant and helpful! So while you’re building up your integration ability, remember to not neglect other areas of mathematics.

No particular reason for writing this, but I just want to say – writing this page has been an absolute nightmare, for some reason. It’s so hard to figure out how to phrase things, structure the narrative, organise the sections, etc. It’s such a mess. I’ll figure it out eventually.
