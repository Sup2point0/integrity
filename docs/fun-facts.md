Here are some cool details about *Integrity*. Spoiler alert!

- The questions and solutions are all written in Markdown. *Integrity* uses a custom parsing engine to process and store the content.
- In the [question browser](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/all), sorting by relevance moves solved questions to the end and flagged questions to the start.
- In [Workspace](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/workspace), when loading questions the LaTeX is sanitised so that itâ€™s compatible with Desmos.
  - For instance, $\sin^3{x}$ is converted to $\sin(x)^3$.
