# Guides

Welcome to the *Integrity* guides. Here you’ll find my walkthroughs, showerthoughts, and adventures in various mathematical topics.

If you’re looking for a refresher on stuff you learnt a while ago, want to learn something entirely new, or are really bored but love maths, then there’s significant evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest you’ve come to the right place.

As ever, I am but a humble wanderer some steps along the infinite path to mathematical proficiency. I share what I’ve encountered in hopes of inspiring and guiding other fellow adventurers. Please don’t hold it against me if I am woefully ignorant of something that is trivially obvious to you! Feedback, corrections and criticisms are of course always welcome.
