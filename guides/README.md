# Guides

Welcome to the *Integrity* guides. These are a collection of my pieces of writing on various mathematical topics, including walkthroughs, documentation and showerthoughts.

If you’re looking for a refresher on stuff you learnt a while ago, want to learn some entirely new, or are really bored but love maths, then there’s significant evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest you’ve come to the right place.

As ever, I am but a humble wanderer some steps along the infinite path to mathematical proficiency. I share what I’ve learnt in the hopes of inspiring and guiding other fellow adventurers. Please do not hold it against me if I am woefully ignorant of something that is perhaps trivially obvious to you. Feedback, corrections and criticisms are always welcome!
