Top $n$ most common errors, slips and faults in integration, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\log(n) > 0$. Based off my personal experience, my experience with other students around me, and internal hypothesisation.[^hypo]

[^hypo]: Seriously, what’s the noun form of “hypothesise”??


### Forgetting +c
Nuff said.

### Integration is not distributive over multiplication

\int f(x) g(x) \ dx \neq \left( \int f(x) dx \right) \left( \int g(x) dx \right)

### Forgetting to distribute the integral coefficient

k \int f(x) + g(x) \ dx &\neq k F(x) + G(x) + c
k \int f(x) + g(x) \ dx &= k F(x) + k G(x) + c

Looks unlikely with $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, but when your functions are fractions and exponents and trigonometric functions, plus you’re worrying about [S-I+G-N errors](../sign.md), it’s way too easy to neglect properly multiplying out the leading coefficient.

### Memorise your standard derivatives and antiderivatives

### Losing track of parts

### Derivative coefficients missing in action
Inverse chain rule

### Dubious exponential algebra

### Phantom division
Not fully dividing through

### Divisive fraction splitting
SIGN

### Remember to substitute your limits too

### Try sketching graphs
It’s a life skill.

### S-I+G-N errors
Need I say any more?

### Caring about the answer more than the method

### Jumping straight to the answer when reading a solution

### Trying to integrate f(x) / x
It’s not possible, mate. e, ln, sin

### Not using Desmos

### Not using Wolfram Alpha

### Not finding integration fun

### Not practising enough
I’m not joking tho.

The best way to become cracked at integration is to just do loads of them.
