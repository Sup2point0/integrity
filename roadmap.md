## Known Issues

I’m finding a fix!

- Navigating backwards in dynamic scripture can clear Desmos window. This is unideal, since it should instead revert to the newest window up until that step.

## Under Development

I’m working on it!

- Mobile-friendly navbar
- Upgrade static scripture routes to all dynamically prerendered
- Speedrun environment
