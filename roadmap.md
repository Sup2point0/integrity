## Known Issues

I’m finding a fix!

- Topic -> displayed text map
- Navigating backwards in dynamic scripture can clear Desmos window. This is unideal, since it should instead revert to the newest window up until that step.
- Dynamic scriptures with many steps can overflow scroll
- Desmos library **Usage**/**Instances** sections do not use a Desmos block
- Dynamic Markdown rendering engine is a custom RegEx-based one, so a lot of features are lacking. Code blocks in particular, which are coming up progressively more in Gamedev in Desmos...
