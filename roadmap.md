## Known Issues

I’m finding a fix!

- Navigating backwards in dynamic scripture can clear Desmos window. This is unideal, since it should instead revert to the newest window up until that step.
- `/desmos/docs/` is empty
- Desmos library **Usage**/**Instances** sections do not use a Desmos block


<br>


## Under Development

I’m working on it!

- Upgrade static scripture routes to all dynamically prerendered
- Speedrun environment
- Automated tests to ensure no errors in builds


<br>


## Upcoming

I will be working on it!

- "Originally written date" for articles
- Index/contents for Desmos library
- Gradient Descent in Desmos dynamic scriptures
