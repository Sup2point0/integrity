## Credits

All questions in *Integrity* were hand-written by myself. Of course, maths is maths, so there is every possibility you may find a particular problem elsewhere too.

### AI
No AI was used for any of these!

(I should hope I am not that bad a mathematician...)

### License
MIT. Please use and distribute these questions however you like – maths is for everyone!
