## Credits

All questions in *Integrity* were created by myself. Of course, maths is maths, so there is every possibility a particular combination of expressions I’ve made has appeared a nonzero number of times elsewhere too. Some questions may also have been inspired by others I have encountered before.

### Contribute
*Integrity* is an independent project for my own maths questions, but I appreciate the sentiment! And if you just want to chat about maths, well, I’m always more than happy to do that >:)

### AI
No AI was used for any of these.

(I should hope I am not that bad a mathematician...)

### License
MIT. Please use and distribute these questions however you like – maths is for everyone!
