Just like with [standard integrals](../../integrals/collections/standard-integrals.md), in graph drawing there are a number of basic graphs that you should absolutely know how to draw.


## Linear

### $y = p$
For any $x$, we produce a constant $y$-value, $p$. In other words, it’s a horizontal straight line.

```desmos
y = p
p = 2
```

### $x = q$
What points in the 2D plane have an $x$-coordinate of $q$? It’s all the points along the vertical line intersecting the $x$-axis at $q$.

It’s identical to $y = p$, only in a different orientation. Just 2 different ways of thinking about the same concept.

```desmos
x = q
q = 3
```

### $y = x$
For every $x$-value, we output an equivalent $y$-value. This looks like a straight line at $45 \degree$ above the positive $x$-axis.

```desmos
y = x
```


## Polynomials

### $x^2$

### $x^3$

### $x^p$

### $x^{2p}$

### $(x-p)(x-q)$

### $(x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(...)$


## Fractional Powers

### $\sqrt{x}$

### $x^{1/p}$


## Exponentials & Logarithms

### $e^x$

### $b^x$

### $\ln(x)$

### $\log_b(x)$


## Reciprocals

### $1/x$

### $1/x^2$

### $1/x^p$


## Miscellaneous

### $|x|$

### $\max(x, 0)$
