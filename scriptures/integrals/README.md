Welcome, adventurer. You’ve come to a realm of problem-solving, extended contemplation, and boundless creativity.

If you’re new here, congratulations on taking your first steps along the path of integration. This is not an easy excursion. It will be challenging; it will require you to *think*; and you will never reach the end. Following this trail mandates you be familiar with differentiation, and even beyond that, general proficiency in all areas of mathematics.

Indeed, the domain of mathematics is uncountably infinite; but so is that of calculus. Within this differentiable interval $(-1, 1)$ you’ll discover just as much richness as what lies in the $(-\infin, \infin)$ of mathematics as a whole. Integration is an art. You can’t learn it in a lifetime, and you won’t learn it in a lifetime – but there is no prize to perfection, only an end to pursuit.

If you’re a seasoned integrator, I trust you will entertain yourself with another traveller’s shared experiences.
