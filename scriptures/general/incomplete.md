It’s coming up to a year since I started writing scriptures on *Integrity*, and you might notice there still aren’t many.

Yeah, there are a number of reasons for this.

First and foremost, what you’re looking at on *Integrity* is about half of the scriptures I’ve “written”. The *other* half is lying scattered across Notes on various phones and Git stash, unfinished and unpolished, waiting to be properly written.

Starting scriptures is fairly easy, but writing them fully is quite difficult. Maybe I just hold myself to too high standards. But I do a *lot* of editing before I even publish an initial version of a scripture.

This results in another issue I have, which is wanting to start writing new pieces instead of finishing off the existing works in progress. Of course, fresh is inevitably more exciting than old, but yeah I really just need to sit down and polish off those unfinished pieces.

Except life is busy, time is finite, and priorities exist. And ultimately, there is other work to be done on *Integrity* which results in ‘content production’ being pushed to the wayside. I’m starting to understand how product companies or project maintainers feel. There is only so much stuff you can devote your time to, and some stuff just loses out.

Don’t worry, I am ever so slowly chipping away at all the scriptures I have planned. I do enjoy writing them, after all. But I am trying to focus on quality before quantity, which makes new releases quite slow indeed.
