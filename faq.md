### What’s *Integrity* for?
It’s a home for all the [maths questions](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions) I’ve created, [guides](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures) I’ve written, [desmos stuff](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos), and various other mathematical adventures. You can find out more in [Synopsis](synopsis.md).

### Who wrote these questions?
Me!

All of these questions were hand-crafted by yours truly.

### What are these questions for?
Some, such as the [*Addvent*](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/addvent) questions, I created for events and competitions at school.

The rest I just come up with for fun, whether to experiment myself or challenge my friends.

Writing questions is a pretty unique and fun way of deeply delving into a topic. You come to appreciate a lot of things you otherwise wouldn’t, and start thinking about the process in a different way. You also gain a really deep intuition for how everything fits together.

### How did you write these questions?
Honestly, I don’t even know. I just gave it a shot, and it turned out I quite enjoyed writing maths problems! It’s a creative and problem-solving process that is satisfying in a similar way to software development or music production.[^similar]

[^similar]: Yeah, I know I say this for everything 💀

A lot of questions are simply the results of permuting different functions – throwing stuff together and seeing what works. Some are built from the ground up with an intended method or track in mind.[^trick] Others take hours of painstaking engineering.[^alt-sol] A rare few come to me in dreams.[^dreams]

[^trick]: It’s like, *“hmmm, what if we did one where you had to use this method...”*
[^alt-sol]: Only for someone to cheese it with a far simpler solution which I unknowingly created, naturally.
[^dreams]: I’m not even joking lmao

### Why are there so many questions?
Oh my days, I actually love creating questions (especially integrals) too much. I came up with like 16 integrals on a coach journey once. They just keep on coming, y’know. You’d think I’m approaching a point where I’ve tried most of the common combinations of the functions in maths, but nope!

### Why are the questions so difficult?
Well, the vast majority of integrals on *Integrity* are made to be nontrivial. I want this site to be a source of high-quality, thought-provoking, handcrafted integrals that aren’t just a test of speed.

Some questions are only tough because they have a very specific and obscure trick.

### Why are the questions so easy?
Okayy, can’t fault you for being too good at maths! The integrals are definitely above A-level level, but I wouldn’t say anything above A-level Further Maths knowledge. (Can confirm: my A-level maths friends could solve most of them.)

And [Addvent](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/addvent) was for Addvent, there’s a reason the questions were accessible.

### What do the difficulty indicators mean?

### I’ve finished all the questions, do you have any more?
Hello!?! Congratulations on solving so many, and tysm for using *Integrity*!

I’m regularly adding more questions (because I can’t seem to stop writing more), so just check back in a bit and there’ll almost certainly be more waiting for you. Also, do drop me a message to let me know, because that’s mad work!

### Can I use these questions?
Absolutely, you’re more than welcome to! For more details, see [Licence](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/licence).

### Why are the scriptures so empty?
It’s a work in progress lmao. I really don’t write fast, and I have way too many other projects I’m working on simultaneously. Also, I’d much rather release complete, polished and actually useful articles than vapid filler to make it look like I’ve done a lot.[^lot] Yes, it’s very unlikely I’ll get round to writing all the articles you can see I have planned in [Explore](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/explore). Such is life ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

[^lot]: The exception are the [Integral Collections](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/integrals/collections), which are eternally works in progress. Also I’m just lazy.

### Why would I want to practise integration?
See [Why Integrate?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/integrals/why)

### Why would I want to practise graph drawing?
See [Why Draw Graphs?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/graph-drawing/why)

### Why would I want to practise completing the square?
See [Why Complete the Square?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/complete-square/why)

### Is my progress saved?
Yes, your data is stored locally in your browser. See [Info / Privacy](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/privacy).

### How was the site built?
See [Synopsis](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/synopsis).

### How are the questions stored?
See [decoded](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/decoded).

### What are the question codes?
They’re unique identifiers for each question which encode its topic, purpose, year etc. You can find out more in [Docs / Shards](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/docs/shards).

### Is dark mode available?
Yep! The site is synced with your local system’s theme, so just enable dark mode on your device.

I decided against allowing different themes on this site, since the focus is on maths :v

### I’d like to request a feature please!
Just [drop an Issue on Github](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues), and if I like the feature, I’ll get round to implementing it!

### Are the questions checked?
All questions are checked with Desmos before being added to *Integrity*, if possible. For those where the solution is difficult to numerically verify, or are just generally horrific, solutions have been verified with either [WolframAlpha<sup>↗</sup>](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) or my mathematically inclined friend [iTechnical](https://github.com/itechnicals).

### Uhh, a question has an incorrect solution?
Ohhh dear, I’ve done it again. *Definitely* drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I’ll fix it as soon as I can.

### Uh, there’s a LaTeX rendering error?
Oh dear, the parsing engine’s flopped again. Or more likely, I’ve made some typo in the source LaTeX. Drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I’ll be right on fixing it.

### Uhhh, the site’s broken?
If the loading overlay’s taking a while, it almost certainly means JavaScript’s broken or crashed. I do check the site after each deployment, so if it’s immediately unusable I will go and fix it.

Again, drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues), ideally with some screenshots and console traces, and I’ll be on it.

### Are you finished with *Integrity*?
Nope, ofc not ;D

*Integrity* is an ever-ongoing project. Somehow, I always have more to fix, more to optimise, and more importantly, more to add!

### Are you still writing questions?
At time of writing, yes! Just nowhere near as often as I used to, as so many other things are occupying my time.

Also, watch out for random dumps of large amounts of questions out of the blue, when I finally get round to copying them from Desmos over to *Integrity* xD
