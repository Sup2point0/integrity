Yes, I’m painfully aware the site’s broken on most versions of Safari. I’m still trying to figure out what change broke it TvT

### What’s *Integrity* for?
It’s a home for all the [maths questions](questions/) I’ve created, [guides](guides/) I’ve written, and various other mathematical adventures. You can find out more in [Synopsis](synopsis.md).

### Who wrote these questions?
Me!

All of these questions were hand-crafted from scratch. A few will no doubt have been inspired by ideas or tricks from other questions I’ve seen before. And of course, this is maths, so there’s no such thing as an ‘original question’ anyway.

### What are these questions for?
Some, such as the [Addvent](questions/addvent/) questions, I created for events and competitions at school.

The rest I just come up with for fun, whether to experiment myself or challenge my friends.

Writing questions is a pretty unique and fun way of deeply delving into a topic – you really learn a lot. You come to appreciate a lot of things you otherwise wouldn’t know, and start thinking about the process in a different way.

### How did you write these questions?
Honestly, I don’t even know. I just gave it a shot, and it turned out I quite enjoyed writing maths problems! It’s a creative and problem-solving process that is satisfying in a similar way to software development or music production.[^similar]

[^similar]: Yeah, I know I say this for everything 💀

A lot of questions are simply the results of permuting different functions – throwing stuff together and seeing what works. Some are built from the ground up with an intended method or track in mind.[^trick] A rare few come to me in dreams.[^dreams] Others take hours of painstaking engineering.[^dreams]

[^trick]: It’s like, *“hmmm, what if we did one where you had to use this method...”*
[^dreams]: I’m not even joking lmao
[^alt-sol]: Only for someone to cheese it with a far simpler solution which I unknowingly created, naturally.

### Why are there so many questions?
Oh my days, I actually love creating questions (especially integrals) too much. I came up with like 16 on a coach journey once. They just keep on coming, y’know. You’d think I’m approaching a point where I’ve tried most of the common combinations of the functions in maths, but nope!

It’s just fun, what can I say.

### Can I use these questions?
Absolutely, you’re more than welcome to! For more details, see [License](README.md#License).

### Why would I want to practise integration?
See [Why Integrate?](guides/integrals/why.md)

### Why would I want to practise graph drawing?
See [Why Draw Graphs?](guides/graph-drawing/why.md)

### Why would I want to practise completing the square?
See [Why Complete the Square?](guides/complete-square/why.md)

### How was the site built?
See [Synopsis](synopsis.md).

### How are the questions stored?
See [decoded](edu.md).

### What are the question codes?
They’re unique identifiers for each question which encode its topic, purpose, year etc. You can find out more in [Docs](docs/shards.md).

### Is dark mode available?
Yep! The site is synced with your local system’s theme. I decided against allowing different themes on this site, since the focus is on maths :v

### Uh, there’s a LaTeX rendering error?
Oh dear, the parsing engine’s flopped again. Or more likely, I’ve made some typo in the source LaTeX. Drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I’ll be right on fixing it.

### Uhh, a question has an incorrect solution?
Ohhh dear, I’ve done it again. *Definitely* drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I’ll fix it as soon as I can.

### Uhhh, the site’s broken?
If the loading overlay’s taking a while, it almost certainly means JavaScript’s broken or crashed. This seems to happen very easily on Safari, but rarely on Chrome. I do check the site after each deployment, so if it’s immediately unusable I will go and fix it.
