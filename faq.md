### What‚Äôs *Integrity* for?
It‚Äôs a home for all the [maths questions](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions) I‚Äôve created, [guides](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures) I‚Äôve written, [desmos stuff](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos), and various other mathematical adventures. You can find out more in [Synopsis](synopsis.md).

### Who wrote these questions?
Me!

All of these questions were hand-crafted from scratch by yours truly.

A few will no doubt have been inspired by ideas or tricks from other questions I‚Äôve seen before. And of course, this is maths, so there‚Äôs no such thing as an ‚Äòoriginal question‚Äô anyway.

### What are these questions for?
Some, such as the [*Addvent*](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/addvent) questions, I created for events and competitions at school.

The rest I just come up with for fun, whether to experiment myself or challenge my friends.

Writing questions is a pretty unique and fun way of deeply delving into a topic ‚Äì you really learn a lot. You come to appreciate a lot of things you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt know, and start thinking about the process in a different way.

### How did you write these questions?
Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know. I just gave it a shot, and it turned out I quite enjoyed writing maths problems! It‚Äôs a creative and problem-solving process that is satisfying in a similar way to software development or music production.[^similar]

[^similar]: Yeah, I know I say this for everything üíÄ

A lot of questions are simply the results of permuting different functions ‚Äì throwing stuff together and seeing what works. Some are built from the ground up with an intended method or track in mind.[^trick] Others take hours of painstaking engineering.[^alt-sol] A rare few come to me in dreams.[^dreams]

[^trick]: It‚Äôs like, *‚Äúhmmm, what if we did one where you had to use this method...‚Äù*
[^alt-sol]: Only for someone to cheese it with a far simpler solution which I unknowingly created, naturally.
[^dreams]: I‚Äôm not even joking lmao

### Why are there so many questions?
Oh my days, I actually love creating questions (especially integrals) too much. I came up with like 16 integrals on a coach journey once. They just keep on coming, y‚Äôknow. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôm approaching a point where I‚Äôve tried most of the common combinations of the functions in maths, but nope!

It‚Äôs just fun, what can I say.

### Why are the questions so difficult?
Well, the vast majority of integrals on *Integrity* are made to be nontrivial. I want this site to be a source of high-quality, thought-provoking, handcrafted integrals that aren‚Äôt just a test of speed.

Some questions are only tough because they have a very specific and obscure trick.

This is less true for the [Completing the Square](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/complete-square) questions, but how hard can completing the square get...

### Why are the questions so easy?
Okayy, can‚Äôt fault you for being too good at maths! The integrals are definitely above A-level level, but I wouldn‚Äôt say anything above A-level Further Maths knowledge. (Can confirm: my A-level maths friends could solve most of them.)

And [Addvent](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/addvent) was for Addvent, there‚Äôs a reason the questions were accessible.

### What do the difficulty indicators mean?
See [Docs / Difficulties](docs/difficulties.md).

### I‚Äôve finished all the questions, do you have any more?
Hello!! Congratulations on solving so many, and tysm for using *Integrity*!

I‚Äôm regularly adding more questions (because I can‚Äôt seem to stop writing more), so just check back in a bit and there‚Äôll almost certainly be more waiting for you.

### Can I use these questions?
Absolutely, you‚Äôre more than welcome to! For more details, see [Licence](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/licence).

### Why are the scriptures so empty?
It‚Äôs a work in progress lmao. I really don‚Äôt write fast, and I have way too many other projects I‚Äôm working on simultaneously. Also, I‚Äôd much rather release complete, polished and actually useful articles than vapid filler to make it look like I‚Äôve done a lot.[^lot] Yes, it‚Äôs very unlikely I‚Äôll get round to writing all the articles you can see I have planned in [Explore](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/explore). Such is life ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[^lot]: The exception are the [Integral Collections](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/integrals/collections), which are eternally works in progress. Also I‚Äôm just lazy.

### Why would I want to practise integration?
See [Why Integrate?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/integrals/why)

### Why would I want to practise graph drawing?
See [Why Draw Graphs?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/graph-drawing/why)

### Why would I want to practise completing the square?
See [Why Complete the Square?](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/complete-square/why)

### How was the site built?
See [Synopsis](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/synopsis).

### How are the questions stored?
See [decoded](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/info/decoded).

### What are the question codes?
They‚Äôre unique identifiers for each question which encode its topic, purpose, year etc. You can find out more in [Docs / Shards](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/docs/shards).

### Is dark mode available?
Yep! The site is synced with your local system‚Äôs theme, so just enable dark mode on your device.

I decided against allowing different themes on this site, since the focus is on maths :v

### I‚Äôd like to request a feature please!
Just [drop an Issue on Github](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues), and if I like the feature, I‚Äôll get round to implementing it!

### Are the questions checked?
All questions are checked with Desmos before being added to *Integrity*, if possible. For those where the solution is difficult to numerically verify, or are just generally horrific, solutions have been verified with either [WolframAlpha<sup>‚Üó</sup>](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) or my mathematically inclined friend [iTechnical](https://github.com/itechnicals).

### Uhh, a question has an incorrect solution?
Ohhh dear, I‚Äôve done it again. *Definitely* drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I‚Äôll fix it as soon as I can.

### Uh, there‚Äôs a LaTeX rendering error?
Oh dear, the parsing engine‚Äôs flopped again. Or more likely, I‚Äôve made some typo in the source LaTeX. Drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues) and I‚Äôll be right on fixing it.

### Uhhh, the site‚Äôs broken?
If the loading overlay‚Äôs taking a while, it almost certainly means JavaScript‚Äôs broken or crashed. I do check the site after each deployment, so if it‚Äôs immediately unusable I will go and fix it.

Again, drop an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity/issues), ideally with some screenshots and console traces, and I‚Äôll be on it.
