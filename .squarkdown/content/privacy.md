By popular request, *Integrity* now counts visits – but apart from that, no data is collected, no analytics are used, no cookies are stored.

...Man, I feel bad just saying that. I hate all the tracking and data farming that sites abuse nowadays without your consent, so I really don’t want my own projects to go anywhere near that stuff. But people keep asking me how many popular *Integrity* is, so I finally caved and added a visit count. It’s literally just a number that gets incremented, so there’s no fingerprinting or privacy concerns at all.

Your history and preferences on *Integrity*, like which questions you’ve marked as solved and how you’d like questions filtered, are stored locally in your browser’s `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. You can view and delete these any time through Developer Tools.
