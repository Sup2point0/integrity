## 1 February

If you’re looking for awesome maths YouTubers to watch, I’ve compiled a [small list of my favourites](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/fun/youtube) :D


## 1 January

Guess what, we’re uploading questions again.

## 31 December

Thanks so much to everyone who’s helped me find bugs, slips and other mishaps on *Integrity*. There’ll inevitably always be more, but I couldn’t do this without you guys &amp;lt;3


## 12 December – A year in Integrity

oops, lowkey missed the anniversary :P

Oh my days, it’s been a year since I created *Integrity*.

This has become perhaps my most unexpected favourite project. I created it on impulse, just as something which I really wanted to make. Fun fact, I was meant to be revising for exams, I did this to procrastinate.

Never thought for a moment it’d grow to what it is today. A hub/wiki/repo of everything maths that I do. I mean it’s almost beaten *Assort*, holy mackerel. It’s the project I like to show people most when they ask what I work on, because it encapsulates 2 of my most core loves.

Time flies, innit. Soon it’ll be 2026. shivers.

I hope I continue to have time to work on *Integrity* and write scriptures. Life is getting busy, but... the contents list in the roadmap still has a lot of pages unchecked ;)


## 28 November

A long-overdue mobile navbar has been added. Still figuring out how best to do dropdowns, bear with me! For now, the current navigation should make mobile a lot more usable without going into horizontal and/or zooming out =)


## 24:00

what a finnicky issue lmao, turns out the top-level navbar `<a>` links were refreshing the page cuz I was setting `target="_self"` on them explicitly, which I suppose interferes with SvelteKit’s on-hover preloading? setting them to `undefined` has fixed it lmao. Enjoy the smoother experience!!


## 27 November

After 3 months of debugging, the [Desmos library](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos/library) is finally correctly deploying and is now accessible.


## 26 November – life is busy

I’m trying to find time to work on *Integrity*, I really am.

(The crippling Rust addiction does not help...)


## 31 October

You can now reset search filters to their defaults (finally!)


## 30 October

Laptop recovered from the dead, and ofc we’re straight back to work on *Integrity*. Many quality-of-life fixes and much long-awaited technical debt to be resolved...


## 23 September

Enjoy a bit of daily maths trivia ;)


## September – 3 months off maths

3 months since I last did serious maths, and I’ve forgotten how to solve differential equations.

Times are bleak.


## 00:21, Thursday 4 September, 上海

I kinda miss *Integrity*...


## 22 August

The [Desmos library](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos/library) has been added. [Gamedev in Desmos](https://sup2point0.github.io/desmos/gamedev) scriptures have been moved from `/scriptures/desmos/` to `/desmos/`.


## 13 July

[Guess the Graph questions](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/guess-the-graph) have been added!


## 9 July

All-new dynamic scriptures with step-by-step walkthroughs have been added for the *Game Development in Desmos* series! Go [check it out](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos/gamedev/prerequisites/graphs).


## 2 July

Graph-drawing questions have (finally) been added! Go [check them out](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/graph-drawing).


## 30 June

Desmos has now been integrated into solutions, so all the integrals involving graph drawing will soon be added!


## 23 June

An expanded grid view has been added, so you can view all of the questions on *Integrity* in all their glory! Access it via the search filters.


## 21 June

You can now view Integrity’s statistics over in [Trails](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/trails), including monthly visit counts and question distributions.


## Integrity now counts visitors


people kept asking me, so

finally caved and added it...

*Integrity* still doesn’t collect any other sorts of tracking or analytics data tho. For the most part, it’s literally just a static site :D


## 200 integrals

I’m not actually writing this when *Integrity* hit 200 integrals, since I (annoyingly) didn’t think to write any kind of ‘blogs’ on *Integrity* at the time.

But yeah, 200 integrals kinda crept up on me. It was actually a pretty significant milestone. I think I realised at the last moment and wrote a special integral ([Duality](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/question/integrals?shard=s25f-sp2)) to celebrate ^v^

The more notable milestone[^notable] was honestly 100 integrals, that one I was actually aiming for

[^notable]: this feels like sacrilege since $200$ is MY number but yes

I felt quite a sense of accomplishment when I reached it. Like, below 50 and the questions are sparse (even tho they can still occupy you for ages); in the 80s and it’s looking a lot fuller; but only when you break 100 is it really like “ok wow, there’s SO much here”.

At the rate I’m going, 300 probably won’t be far away keke


## Integrity now has a blog lmao

didn’t think we’d up here but here we are

I’m writing this when I decided to move these articles over to a blog btw, so this is not actually the oldest post :P
