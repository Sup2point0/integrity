## 2025

</div> -->



## 31 October
You can now reset search filters to their defaults (finally!)


## 30 October
Laptop recovered from the dead, and ofc we’re straight back to work on *Integrity*. Many quality-of-life fixes and much long-awaited technical debt to be resolved...


## 23 September
Enjoy a bit of daily maths trivia ;)


## 3 months off maths

3 months since I last did serious maths, and I’ve forgotten how to solve differential equations.

Times are bleak.


## 22 August
The [Desmos library](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/desmos/library) has been added. [Gamedev in Desmos](https://sup2point0.github.io/desmos/gamedev) scriptures have been moved from `/scriptures/desmos/` to `/desmos/`.


## I kinda miss Integrity


## 13 July
[Guess the Graph questions](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/guess-the-graph) have been added!


## 9 July
All-new dynamic scriptures with step-by-step walkthroughs have been added for the *Game Development in Desmos* series! Go [check it out](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/scriptures/desmos/gamedev/prerequisites/graphs).


## 2 July
Graph-drawing questions have (finally) been added! Go [check them out](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/questions/graph-drawing).


## 30 June
Desmos has now been integrated into solutions, so all the integrals involving graph drawing will soon be added!


## 23 June
An expanded grid view has been added, so you can view all of the questions on *Integrity* in all their glory! Access it via the search filters.


## 21 June
You can now view Integrity’s statistics over in [Trails](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/trails), including monthly visit counts and question distributions.


## Integrity now counts visitors

people kept asking me, so

finally caved and added it...

*Integrity* still doesn’t collect any other sorts of tracking or analytics data tho. For the most part, it’s literally just a static site :D


## 200 integrals

I’m not actually writing this when *Integrity* hit 200 integrals, since I (annoyingly) didn’t think to write any kind of ‘blogs’ on *Integrity* at the time.

But yeah, 200 integrals kinda crept up on me. It was actually a pretty significant milestone. I think I realised at the last monent and wrote a special integral ([Duality](https://sup2point0.github.io/integrity/question/integrals?shard=s25f-sp2)) to celebrate ^v^

The more notable milestone[^notable] was honestly 100 integrals, that one I was actually aiming for

[^notable] this feels like sacrilege since $200$ is MY number but yes

I felt quite a sense of accomplishment when I reached it. Like, below 50 and the questions are sparse (even tho they can stoll occupy you for ages); in the 80s and it’s looking a lot fuller; but only when you break 100 is it really like “ok wow, there’s SO much here”.

At the rate I’m going, 300 probably won’t be far away lmao


## Integrity now has a blog lmao

didn’t think we’d up here but here we are

I’m writing this when I decided to move these articles over to a blog btw, so this is not actually the oldest post :P
