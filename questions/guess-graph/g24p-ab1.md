```


## Options
```desmos
y = \left(x-1\right)\left(x+2\right)
y = \left(x+1\right)\left(x-2\right)
y = \left(x-1\right)\left(x-2\right)
y = \left(x-1\right)^{2}
```


## Hints

### 1
It looks like a parabola.

### 2
What are the intercepts?

### 3
A quadratic $y = (x-p)(x-q)$ has roots $p$ and $q$.
