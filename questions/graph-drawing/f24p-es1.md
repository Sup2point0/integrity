## Question
```math
y = e^{x}\sin\left(e^{x}\right)
```


## Options
```desmos
e^{x}\sin\left(e^{x}\right)
\sin\left(e^{x}\right)
e^{x}\sin x
e^{-x}\sin\left(e^{x}\right)
```


## Hints

### 1
Consider $\sin(e^x)$ individually first.

### 2
What happens to the frequency of the sine wave?

### 3
The whole sine wave is then also scaled by $e^x$.


## Solution

Coming soon!
