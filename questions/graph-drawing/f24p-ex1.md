## Question
```math
y = \frac{e^{x}}{x}
```


## Options
```desmos
\frac{e^{x}}{x}
xe^{x}
\frac{e^{x}}{x^{2}}
e^{x}+x
```


## Hints

### 1
Start by drawing $e^x$.

### 2
As $x \to 0$, weâ€™re dividing $e^x$ by an increasingly tiny value.

### 3
As $x \to \infin$, $e^x$ grows faster than $x$.


## Solution
