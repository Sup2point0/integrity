## Question
```math
y = e^{x}\ln x
```


## Options
```desmos
e^{x}\ln x
x^{x}
\frac{\ln x}{x}
\frac{e^{-x}}{x}
```


## Hints

### 1
What happens as $x \to 0^{+}$?

### 2
What happens as $x \to \infin$?

### 3
When does the graph cross the $y$ axis?

### 4
Between $0 < x < 1$, the graph looks essentially like $\ln(x)$.

### 5
After $1 < x$, the graph essentially looks like $e^x$.


## Solution

Coming soon!
