## Question

I received a Christmas present in the shape of a $15 \text{cm} \times 19 \text{cm} \times 25 \text{cm}$ box.

There is a ribbon of width $3 \text{cm}$ covering every face of the box in a “+” shape.

<strong>What proportion of the total surface area is not covered by ribbon?</strong>


## Hint

### 1
What’s the total surface area?

### 2
Assume the “+” is centred on each face.

### 3
Try drawing a diagram of 1 face.


## Answer
$1616/2270$ or $808/1135$ or $71.19 \%$


## Solution


## Alternates

It doesn’t actually matter where the “+” on each face is centred.
