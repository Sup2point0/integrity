## Question

Suppose a 16-year-old is lying down in a snow field, peacefully drawing snow angels.

They have arms of length $r$ and legs of length $s$, where $r$ and $s$ are integers. $r + s$ is less than their age, and their legs are, in fact, longer than their arms.

They cast their arms and legs around in circular motions, with each arm drawing out an area of $r/2$ and each leg $s/2$.

Magically, it turns out that if you double the total area theyâ€™ve drawn and add their age to it, you get exactly the product $rs$.

<strong>Can you find the total area they drew?</strong>


## Hint

### 1
What is the total area they drew out in terms of $r$ and $s$?

### 2
Set up an equation involving $r$ and $s$.

### 3
$r$ and $s$ are integers!


## Answer

$13$


## Solution

### Solve
```math
\begin{align*}
  &= 
  \\ &= 
\end{align*}
```
