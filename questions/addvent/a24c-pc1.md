## Question

Last year, it took $8$ days for $200$ elves in the North Atlantic Pinecone Association to prepare $384,000$ presents.

This year, the Pinecone Association has an order of only $277,200$ presents. However, $35$ elves have resigned from the company due to complaints over the quality of icewater served at lunch.

If the remaining elves continue to work at the same rate this year, how long will it take them to prepare all the presents?


## Hints

### 1
How many presents do 200 elves prepare in 8 days?

### 2
How many presents, then, would 1 elf prepare in 8 days?

### 3
And in a single day?


## Answer
7 days


## Solution

### Solve
$200$ elves prepares $384000$ presents in $8$ days. Therefore each elf in 1 day prepares $384000 / 200 / 8 = 240$ presents. (We can think of this like the *work rate* per elf, $1 \, \text{present} / \text{day} / \text{elf}$)

Since $35$ elves are gone, there are now $200 - 35 = 165$ elves left. Each day they prepare $240 \cdot 165 = 39600$ presents. Hence it will take them $277200 / 39600 = 7$ days in total to prepare all the presents.
