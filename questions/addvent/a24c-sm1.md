## Question
I am building a giant snowman. My design consists of 3 large spherical snowballs, with radii $12\ \text{m}$, $18\ \text{m}$, and $x\ \text{m}$.

I first place the largest snowball on the ground. I then stack the next largest snowball on top of it, but this knocks $1/6$ of the total volume of the 2 snowballs onto the ground!

Finally, I stack the smallest snowball on top of the 2 snowballs, which knocks yet another $1/6$ of the total volume of the 3 snowballs off.

If my snowman is now left with a volume of $10445\pi\ \text{m}^3$ of snow, what is the largest value $x$ could have been?


## Hints

### 1
Set up an equation involving $x$.

### 2
Does the value of $x$ affect what equation you would construct?

### 3
What happens if $x < 12 < 18$? Or $12 < 18 < x$?


## Answer
$x = 15$


## Solution

### Solve
```math
\begin{align*}
  &= 
  \\ &= 
\end{align*}
```
